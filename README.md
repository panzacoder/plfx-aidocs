## Prerequisites

### Bun

Bun is the only prerequisite you need to install before getting started.

To install Bun, please follow the official installation instructions:

[Bun Installation Guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)


## Getting Started

You have two options to create a new v1 project:

### Option 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

To create a new v1 project using our CLI tool, run:

```bash
bun create @convex-dev/v1@latest
```

This command will guide you through the process of setting up your project, including:

1. Creating a new directory for your project
2. Cloning the v1 repository
3. Installing dependencies
4. Initializing a git repository
5. Setting up the Convex backend
6. Configuring authentication
7. Setting up environment variables
8. Adding test products to Polar
9. Seeding the database for subscriptions

After the setup is complete, you can start your development server by running:

```bash
cd your-project-name
bun dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the project manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   bunx degit get-convex/v1 v1
   cd v1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Initialize git repository:
   ```bash
   git init && git commit -am 'initial commit'
   ```

4. Set up Convex backend:
   ```bash
   cd packages/backend
   npm run setup
   ```
   This will create a new Convex project. It will fail after project creation due to missing environment variables, which is expected at this stage.

5. Set up authentication:
   ```bash
   npx @convex-dev/auth
   ```
   Follow the prompts to configure authentication for your project.

6. Set up environment variables:
   If you prefer to set up services manually or want more control over the process, refer to the [Detailed Service Setup Instructions](#detailed-service-setup-instructions) section below.

7. Copy Convex environment variables:
   - Copy the contents of `packages/backend/.env`
   - Paste these variables into the environment variables panel in your Convex
     dashboard

8. Initialize Polar products and seed database:
   ```bash
   cd packages/backend
   bunx convex run init
   ```

9. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   This starts everything in development mode (web, app, api, email).

   Alternatively, you can start specific parts of the application:
   - `bun dev:web`: starts the web app
   - `bun dev:app`: starts the app
   - `bun dev:convex`: starts the Convex API
   - `bun dev:email`: starts the email app

## Deployment

To deploy your v1 project to production, follow these steps:

### Deploying to Vercel

This repo contains two Next.js apps, you can deploy one or both to Vercel. Each
would be a separate Vercel project.

Steps to deploy a Vercel project with Convex can be found
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel#deploying-to-vercel).


### Production Environment Variables

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**
  _Optional for apps/web_
  This is the URL for your deployed app, e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`.
  It is used by the marketing site to link to the app.

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL**
  _Required for both apps_
  This is the URL for your deployed Convex instance, e.g.,
  `https://your-project-name.convex.cloud`.
